**DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a client/server protocol that automatically provides an Internet Protocol (IP) host with its IP address and other related configuration information such as the subnet mask and default gateway. 

**TCP(Transmisson Control Protocol)**
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network.

**subnet mask**
A subnet mask is a 32-bit number used in IPv4 (or 128-bit for IPv6) that divides your IP address into network and host portions. The network portion ensures that data packets reach the right network, while the host portion identifies a specific device on that network.
Subnetting –– or dividing the network into smaller pieces –– is used to make the network easier to maintain.

**IPv4**
IPv4 stands for Internet Protocol version 4

**gataway**
A gateway is a network node used in telecommunications that connects two networks with different transmission protocols together

**HTTP**
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load webpages using hypertext links.

**SSL(Secure Sockets Layer)**
Secure Sockets Layer
SSL: Secure Sockets Layer
SSL is standard technology for securing an internet connection by encrypting data sent between a website and a browser (or between two servers).

**TLS**
TLS: Transport Layer Security

TLS is an updated, more secure version of SSL. We still refer to our security certificates as SSL because it’s a more common term, but when you buy SSL from DigiCert, you get the most trusted, up-to-date TLS certificates.

**socket**
a natural or artificial hollow into which something fits or in which something revolves.

**SOCKES5**
SOCKS5, in itself, is a framework for a General Proxy Protocol as it allows several application layer protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP to relay data securely and transparently. Ideally, these application layer protocols require that a different proxy server be set up before data can be shared.

**cookie**
a packet of data sent by a web server to a browser, which is returned by the browser each time it subsequently accesses the same server, used to identify the user or track their access to the server.

**UTF-8**
UTF-8 is an encoding system for Unicode

**Telnet**
Telnet is a network protocol used to virtually access a computer and provide a two-way, collaborative and text-based communication channel between two machines.

It follows a user command TCP/IP networking protocol that creates remote sessions. On the web, HTTP and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) enable users to request specific files from remote computers. With Telnet, users can log on as a regular user with privileges that allow them to access the specific applications and data on that computer.

**session**
In computer science and networking in particular, a session is a time-delimited two-way link, a practical (relatively high) layer in the TCP/IP protocol enabling interactive expression and information exchange between two or more communication devices or ends – be they computers, automated systems, or live active users (see login session)

**difference between TCP and UDP**
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, whereas UDP is a connectionless protocol
